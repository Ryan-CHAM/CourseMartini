## Development Environment

Course Martini is based on Ruby on Rails. Before running our codes on localhost, you have to set the environment first. About how to set the environment, please refer to this [tutorial](https://railsbook.tw/chapters/02-environment-setup.html)

## Code structure

### About
 As the framework of ruby on rails is relatively rare, this section will introduce the structure of the framework to provide a better understanding to our codes.
 
### Devise
 Devise is a huge user managing module that is used on rails. It creates a huge MVC structure for user, many parts in our code related to users are generated by this module. [Click here to know more about devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise)
 
### Controller
  The controllers are placed at:
  > /app/controllers
  Only the users folder is generated by the devise module

### Model
  The models are placed at:
  > /app/models
  The model part is for seting up validations(e.g. length) for data creation, and implementing functions for data manipulation.
 
### View
  The views are placed at:
  > /app/views
  All of our views are implemented based on bootstrap to serve users with differen screen sizes.

### Stylesheets
  The stylesheets are placed at:
  > /app/assets/stylesheets
  The file format is "scss" rather than "css" in rails.
  The stylesheets are all shared among pages regardless of name, it is seperated to different files for different priority in different views.
  
### Javascripts
  The javascripts are placed at:
  > /app/assets/javascript/packs
  Ruby on rails is not a pure js based framework in terms of coding. The application.js in this directory links to all required js files (e.g. jquery, bootstrap's js) that are hidden in the rails framework.
  
### Routes
  The route file is placed at:
  > /config/routes.rb
  This file controls the response towards html requests for routing
  
### Database
  The database related files are placed at:
  > /db
  Our project uses sqlite as our database.
  The table and columns are defined in the file schema.rb in the above directory.
  Creating and manipulating tables are through options using terminal commands, and changes will be shown under the folder:
  > /db/migrate
  The database data is stored at 
  > /db/development.sqlite3
  
### Gemfiles
  Gemfiles are ruby packages that helps development of website.
  The list of used gems are listed in (It is a file, not folder):
  > /Gemfile
  Packages such as bootstrap, jquery are all listed inside, and a bundler will help install the package to our software.
